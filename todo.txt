1)  Registration Use Case
    User calls the page. User should see a blog with navigation links to
    Register and Login. User clicks on Register and comes to a form.
    After submitting we take the form data and validate it. If valid we
    store the user in our database with a hashed+salt password. User will be
    then redirected to the blog start page. This time the navs change to Logout.

2)  Login Use Case
    User calls the page. User should see a blog with navigation links to
    Register and Login. User clicks on Login and comes to a form.
    After submitting we take the form data and validate it. If valid we
    then we log the user by setting the cookie, so the browser knows there is
    a user logged. We dont store a logged attribute inside the database, because
    cookies are a more flexible, faster approach. Then the user will be
    then redirected to the blog start page. This time the navs change to Logout.

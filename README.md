# Introduction

This is my project that I created during a wonderful udacity class. It is a little movie library showing my favorite movies.
The main parts of this projects are:
  * **entertainment_center.py**: This file represents our little database with hard coded objects inside. Further it calls a function which renders and opens a html page.
  * **media.py**: Inside we find our movie class which will be used by entertainment_center to create instances of this class
  * **fresh_tomatoes.html**: An html file of our movie library
  * **fresh_tomatoes.py**: A file given by udacity that takes an array of movies and renders them into html
